# Predicting Hospital Readmission with Machine Learning
### Domain: Healthcare Data Science

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 10 years of clinical data from 130 US hospitals to predict 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients.

## Key Insights
* **Insulin Impact:** Patients with adjusted insulin doses showed a ~4% higher readmission risk.
* **Polypharmacy:** High-risk patients averaged 17+ medications compared to 15 for stable patients.
* **Top Predictor:** The Random Forest model identified **Number of Lab Procedures** as the most critical feature for prediction.

## Tech Stack
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier)
